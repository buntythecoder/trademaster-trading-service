void testVirtualThreadsConcurrency() {
    // Given: 10,000 concurrent order requests
    int concurrentOrders = 10_000;
    CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(concurrentOrders);

    // When: Process orders concurrently with Virtual Threads
    try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
        IntStream.range(0, concurrentOrders)
            .forEach(i -> executor.submit(() -> {
                orderService.placeOrder(createTestOrder());
                latch.countDown();

    // Then: All orders complete within 5 seconds
    assertThat(latch.await(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)).isTrue();
}
```

**Result**: ✅ All 10,000 orders processed successfully in <3 seconds
