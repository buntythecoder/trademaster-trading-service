## Notes & Conventions

### Development Guidelines
1. **Always use Context7**: For framework references, best practices, design patterns
2. **Follow Railway Programming**: Use Result<T,E> for all operations that can fail
3. **No Exceptions in Business Logic**: Use Try or Result monads
4. **Pattern Matching Over if-else**: Always use switch expressions
5. **Streams Over Loops**: Use Stream API for all collection processing
6. **Records for DTOs**: All data transfer objects must be Records
7. **Sealed Interfaces**: For type hierarchies with pattern matching
8. **Circuit Breakers**: On ALL external API calls
9. **Correlation IDs**: In ALL log entries and service calls
10. **Test First**: Write tests before implementation where possible

### Quality Gates (Must Pass Before Task Complete)
- ✅ No compilation errors or warnings
- ✅ No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
- ✅ Cognitive complexity ≤ 7 per method
- ✅ Method length ≤ 15 lines
- ✅ Class size ≤ 200 lines
- ✅ Unit test coverage >80%
